# Goals:
- Website Goals:
	- COGS is active
	- COGS is doing good things. 
	- Here's how I can become involved. 
- **Completed by Aug. 5**


# Brainstorming Ideas:

- For each main folder, have a dashboard for each that I can link to in the homepage. 
- Each subset homepage (ex: News or Finances or Resources) has a dataview that shows the most recent notes with that tag or something. 
- It also clearly links to other topics or things people might be interested in. 
- Separate into different categories like End the Fees or COGS vs Board of Regents. 
- Make the COGS website into a resource center for new and current grads. 
- Use [Digital Archive](./Digital%20Archive.md) to also update the website.
