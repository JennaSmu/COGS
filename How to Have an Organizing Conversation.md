# Issues:
- Ask what the worker cares about before asking them to participate in an action. 
- Ground the conversation in the issues they care about. 

# Agitation:
- COGS member acknowledges the issue isn't okay with them. And that the issue isn't going away on its own. 
- Ask, "How long has this issue been going on? Is that okay with you?"

# Polarization:
- Isolate the people responsible for issue or who holds the power to make change. 
- Ask, "Why do you think you/we are having this problem?"

# Vision of Change: 
- Talk about the union's plans to change things. 
- Articulate the union's plan to win change
- Make connection between the worker's union and the action at hand. 

# Commitment:
- Get the worker to move forward by going to a meeting, signing a petition, show up to an action, become a steward, or talk to their coworkers about issues.
