## Health Care: _The Union Difference_

Before UE-COGS, the University's only graduate employee health care plan was SHIP (Student Health Insurance Plan), offering meager catastrophic coverage and no preventive care. Since 1997, our union contract has made GradCare available to TAs and RAs and their families. GradCare is an affordable, comprehensive health and prescription drug plan. Our contract guarantees that the UI will cover **90%** of the premium cost for single employees, and **70%** of the premium cost for domestic partners, spouses, children, and families (see below). For a more detailed description of coverages and co-pays, go to [http://www.cogs.org/contract.htm#AppendixA](http://www.cogs.org/contract.htm#AppendixA)

### Dental Care: _The Union Difference_

Another benefit made possible by our union is dental insurance. Our contract requires the UI to pay **85%** of the premium cost for employees who sign up for dental coverage. For graduate employees with dependents, the UI is required to pay **70%** of the premium cost for dependent and family plans.

## Enrolling for Health and Dental Coverage

Insurance coverage for new RAs/TAs with academic year appointments begins September 1 (August 1 for fiscal year appointments). New employees must **submit a Health Insurance Application to the UI Benefits Office (120 USB) by September 9, 2017**Â in order to receive coverage retroactive to September 1. You should receive a benefits booklet, including this form from the university at your home or campus address. If you do not receive by September 1, you can request a form from the Benefits Office by phoning 335-2676 or [website](http://www.uiowa.edu/hr/benefits/healthinfo/index_grad.html). Forms and assistance are also available from your COGS Steward and at the COGS Office (phone 337-5074).

**International Students**: International students are routinely auto-enrolled in the Student Health Insurance Plan (SHIP). If you are an international student hired for an assistantship of 25% or more, you have the right to switch to UI GradCare, which provides much better coverage for a slightly greater monthly cost for RAs, TAs, and family members. To change coverage, circle UI GradCare on the Health Insurance Application.

**Dental Care**: To sign up for dental coverage, circle "Dental" on the Graduate Employee Health Insurance Application. **You must sign up for dental care during an open enrollment period (September, January, or June). **NOTE*:** The Dental option is not printed on the Graduate _Student_ Health Insurance Application, so if using one of these forms, you must write and circle "Dental" next to UI GradCare.

**Selecting a Primary Care Manager**: Primary care physicans are available throughout the UIHC system for anyone on UIGradCare. This includes physicians in the Family Practice and Internal Medicine Clinics at UIHC, the Community Medical Service Clinics, and Student Health Service. Student Health Services director Dr. Mary Kowassah is automatically identified as the care manager for all graduate employees. Employees are, however, encouraged to develop a relationship with a physician at any of these clinics and to request her/him by name when calling for appointments. Information on Student Health Physicians on staff is available at [http://www.uiowa.edu/~shs/general_info/staff.shtml](http://www.uiowa.edu/%7Eshs/general_info/staff.shtml). Assistance in selecting another physican in the UIHC system can be found through UI Health Access [http://www.uihealthcare.com/depts/uihealthaccess/index.html](http://www.uihealthcare.com/depts/uihealthaccess/index.html)). Female employees may designate a co-care manager from UIHC OB/Gyn; spouses, partners, and children must designate a primary care manager from UIHC Family Practice, Internal Medicine, or Pediatrics (lists available inside UI Benefits Booklet).
