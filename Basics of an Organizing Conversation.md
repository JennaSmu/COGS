Narrative – Before you start a conversation, make sure you have the narrative you want to present ready.  This includes both your personal narrative (who you are, why you joined COGS, why you’re volunteering) and how to pitch membership.

Introduction – Give your name, that you’re with COGS, and make a connection.  This can be as simple as “I’m a fellow grad student from [related department]” or “I teach in this building sometimes, don’t you hate those windows that don’t open?”  The more you connect with them, the more likely they are to listen to you.

Inquiry – Make sure to ask questions of them to keep them involved.  Always get their name.  If it seems appropriate, also ask about their job, their research, general information about their department, anything else that seems important to them.  Offer the same information back.  After you feel you’ve built rapport, ask what they know about COGS.

Conversation – Give them your narrative: what COGS is, why you’re a dues-paying member, why COGS is important.  Ask if they have any questions for you.  Ask how their work is going.  Ask if they have any issues in their department.

Commitment – It’s time for “the ask.”  If they aren’t a dues-paying member, ask them to sign up right there.  It will probably feel awkward, but it will never feel less awkward than right now.

Evaluate – If they aren’t willing to commit, ask why.  Make notes of what they say.  If they already are a dues-paying member or sign up on the spot, ask if they would consider becoming a steward for their department.

Educate – Regardless of whether they are a dues-paying member or not, talk to them about current COGS campaigns, ask if they will join for upcoming events, etc.  Every member of the bargaining unit is welcome at meetings, especially if they want to know more before paying dues.

# Some Do’s and Don’ts
✅Do insist on asking people to sign up on the spot.  90% of people who say they’ll sign up later don’t actually do so.
✅Do listen to what they’re saying.  Even if you don’t get a new member, getting information about the department is still very helpful.
✅Do take notes and write down ratings.  The more information we have recorded, the better.
✅Do leave literature and information about upcoming events.  It serves as a reminder after we’ve left.
✅Do use “we” and “us” when talking about the union.  Use “our union” to refer back to COGS.  Make it clear via pronouns that you and they are already involved in the union.  
✅Do check when someone tells you they are a dues-paying member.  Frequently, people who think they’re dues-paying members are not.
❌Don’t ask “Do you have time to talk?”  Most people are conditioned to respond “no” to this question.  Start talking, and if they’re pressed for time, they’ll tell you.
❌Don’t do all the talking yourself.  A good organizing conversation should be about 80/20 talking and listening.
❌Don’t ask yes/no questions.  Instead of asking “Is everything good in your department?” ask “What issues or concerns do you have about your department?”
❌Don’t assume you know why the person you’re talking to refused to join.  As soon as you think something like “they’re just a freeloader” or “too cheap” or “they just don’t get it,” the person you’re talking to can tell, and the conversation will be over.
