Issued by UE Local 896, Campaign to Organize Graduate Students (COGS)

Preamble

We, the members of the Campaign to Organize Graduate Students (United Electrical Workers Local 896), recognize that we can improve our living and working conditions only when we unite to protect ourselves against the organized power of our employer. We therefore pledge ourselves to struggle for and defend the right of all graduate employees to fair working conditions, including but not limited to a living wage, comprehensive health care, child care, an effective grievance procedure, tuition waivers, and freedom from discrimination and harassment.

As employees of the University of Iowa and workers in the academy, we insist on the right of all students to democratic participation in university governance, and we commit ourselves to fighting for higher education that is accessible to all, regardless of class or income; race or ethnicity; sexual orientation; gender; HIV, immigration, or disability status; national origin; age; and religious or political beliefs or affiliation. We call for renewed public commitment to creating the conditions necessary to quality education: respect and material support for all academic workers, class sizes which foster the meaningful exchange of ideas, and uncompromising dedication to academic freedom.

As part of the international labor movement we take our stand with all workers in the struggle for a higher standard of living and democratic control over the conditions of our lives.

In that spirit we create a rank and file organization dedicated to aggressive advocacy for workers‚Äô rights.

It will serve to bring these concerns to the leadership and General Membership as central issues and part of everyday Union business. It will be active in assisting this Local to achieve its goal of a unified Union, truly representing all of its members.
