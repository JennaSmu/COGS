General notes: With few exceptions, any room with multiple names on the door is a grad student office, and any room with just one name on the door is a faculty office. Large offices with cubicles are generally grad student offices as well. If you can’t see that an office is empty through a window in the door, you should knock just in case.  

  

Pentacrest Buildings

  

Jessup Hall (JH)

Departments: Geography & Sustainability Sciences, School of Planning & Public Affairs

Geography grads have all their offices along the 2nd floor central hallway (there should be 4 offices with 4-6 people in them).  The large central room on the 3rd floor is nearly exclusively inhabited by grad students in Urban & Regional Planning; don’t be afraid to go up and talk to anyone in that room.

  

MacBride Hall (MH)

Departments: Anthropology, Mathematics, Computer Science

The building has a giant lecture hall in the middle; when there’s a class in it, you can only go from one end to the other through the basement.  One side houses the anthropology students mostly on the North end of the second floor where the COGS bulletin board is posted. Some hold hours in labs in the basement. The other side of the building has several large open rooms for math and CS grad students. For the math/CS space, nearly all the people there are grad students, so talk to everyone.

  

Maclean Hall (MLH)

Departments: Computer Sciences, Mathematics

Most of the CS grads are in computer labs on the 3rd floor central hallway; it’s locked so you’ll have to knock to get in.  Math grad students are in offices scattered throughout nearly every floor, generally one or two offices on the loops at the ends of the building.  There are also several math grad offices along the central hallway in the basement, and a large room where math grads hold office hours on the first floor.

  

Schaeffer Hall (SH)

Departments: History, Political Science, Statistics & Actuarial Science

The History grads are mostly housed in the large cubicle room at one end of the 3rd floor.  The History Writing Center is also on the 3rd floor, where grads sometimes hold hours.  Many of the Poli Sci grads are in a couple rooms along the 3rd floor central hallway and the semicircle side hallway in the middle of the building.  The rest of the grads can be found scattered throughout the building on all floors, in offices in the corners of the building.  Look for offices with multiple names on them, or with nothing but a department and multiple desks.

  

Cleary Walkway Buildings

  

Blank Honors Center (BHC)

Department: assorted (usually College of Ed and Interdisciplinary Studies)

There is one large grad student office on the 6th floor which usually has a couple grad students in it.  The students in the building work in the Honors Center, but most are students in other departments.

  

Chemistry Building (CB)

Department: Chemistry

The grad students are in the corners of the building, nearly all require you to go through a set of metal double doors to get to them.  Instead of having names on the doors, the grad student offices are mostly labeled “[Professor] Research Group”.  Some are typical grad offices with desks and computers, some are labs; don’t be afraid to knock on the lab doors if you see people inside.

  

Gilmore Hall (GILH)

Department: Religious Studies

There are 3-4 shared offices on the 3rd floor attached to the large central room that house all of the grad students in the building.

  

Halsey Hall (HH)

Department: Dance

The graduate students all share small offices (usually two per office)  in the basement around W114-118 or so on the side closer to the parking ramp/Fitness East

  

North Hall (NH)

Departments: Sociology, Social Work

The Social Work department is nominally on the floor you enter on (coming from the Cleary Walkway), but grad students in the department almost never have offices.  The floor above is Sociology; there is a large computer space for grad students and a locked lounge area (knock to get in if there are people there).

  

Pappajohn Business Building (PBB)

Departments: College of Business (Accounting, Business Analytics, Economics, Finance, Management & Entrepreneurship, Marketing)

Grad offices are primarily on the 2nd and 3rd floors, with each department taking a South or West wing. Grad offices can be identified by multiple names on the door listing (usually more than two), and generally have times/days posted for their office hours. Worth knocking on closed doors as you can’t tell if they are occupied from the outside. The cafe on the ground floor can be a good place to grab a coffee and recharge if needed!

  

Trowbridge Hall (TH)

Department: Earth & Environmental Studies (Geology)

The grad students are tucked away in weird corners of this building.  There’s one office on the third floor (entrance floor from the Cleary Walkway) that requires you to go through a classroom just to the right of the back staircase.  The rest of the grad students are in “The Maze” on the first floor (there are generally signs to guide you there).

  

Buildings Across the River

  

Art Building West (ABW)

Department: Art & Art History

All of the Art History grad students are in the same large room with cubicles, just down the hallway from the main entrance.

  

College of Public Health Building (CPHB)

Departments: College of Public Health (Biostatistics, Community & Behavioral Health, Epidemiology, Health Management & Policy, Occupational & Environmental Health)

This building is split into north and south halves, with each half of a floor housing a different department.  The 2nd floor south has a lounge with several TA offices past it, and the north end houses HMP; the 3rd floor has OEH on the south and Biostats on the north; and the 4th floor has Epi on the south and CBH on the north.  Other than the TA offices on the 2nd floor near the student common area,, most of the grad students are RAs, and interspersed throughout their departments.  As usual, look for offices with more than one name on the door, though a couple grads have a single office with the label “Graduate Student” under their name.

  

College of Pharmacy Building (CPB)

Department: Pharmacy

  

Pharmaceutical Sciences Research Building (PHAR)

Department: Pharmacy

  

Field House (FH)

Department: Health & Human Physiology

The entire building is generally locked, and the grad student offices hidden back behind the racquetball courts (I think?).  Recommended to visit with someone who has access to the building and is familiar with its layout.

  

Theater Building (TB)

Department: Theater Arts

All of the grad student offices are next to each other in the basement; go through the double doors to the left of the main entrance, go down the stairs, then go down the hallway until you can turn right; all the offices are there.

  

Stanley Hydraulics Laboratory (SHL)

Department: Hydroscience Engineering

The grad student offices are on the 2nd and 3rd floors, so go straight up the stairs.  There’s a large cubicle room where anyone without a door or a large desk is a grad student (the smaller room connected to it is entirely faculty and postdocs).  There’s a second office with grad students on the second floor at the far end of the hallway.  The third floor has a grad office directly above and identical to the large cubicle room on the second floor.

  

Visual Arts Building (VAB)

Department: Art & Art History

Grad students are scattered all over the building, which has a central spiral ramp you can use to work your way up or down it.  Many of the grads work in shared graduate studios (Photography is on the 1st floor, sculpture and graphic design on the 2nd, intermedia on the 3rd, and printmaking on the 4th), all of which you can at least knock on, and probably can just walk into.  The third floor also includes a number of painting studios; unlike most buildings, the grad students in painting have individual studios; the way to distinguish between grad students and faculty is that faculty have their field listed under their names, while grad students do not.

  

Buildings Along the River

  

Adler Journalism Building (AJB)

Departments: Journalism & Mass Communication, Cinematic Arts

Grad offices are on the 2nd and 3rd floors, in the rooms with multiple names on the doors.  The floors above the ground floor have east and west corridors; most of the grad offices are on the inside edge of the east corridor.

  

Becker Communication Studies Building (BCSB)

Departments: Communication Studies, Cinematic Arts

The Comm Studies grad students are all clustered near each other on the south end of the first floor; there are five grad student offices all at the end of the same short hallway, and another three along the hallway through the door right near them.  Grad student offices have multiple names on the door.  There are also three grad student offices for Cinematic Arts next to each other in a corner of the 3rd floor.

  

English-Philosophy Building (EPB)

Departments: English, Philosophy, Rhetoric

Most of the grad students (all of the Rhetoric TAs and many of the English TAs) are in the offices at the west end of the basement.  Not all the occupied grad offices in the basement have names on them, so be sure to knock just in case.  The Philosophy department offices are directly above the Rhetoric offices; there are only a couple grad offices and they’re the ones with multiple names on the door.  There is a large cubicle room on the 3rd (?) floor that sometimes houses overflow English grad students.  The Nonfiction Department has grad offices that require you to go into the office and to the left; there are also a couple lounges you can see from outside the office where grad students sometimes hang out.

  

Iowa Advanced Technology Laboratories (IATL)

Departments: Physics & Astronomy, Mechanical Engineering, Chemical Engineering

When you enter, you’ll go down a hallway, past the reception area, and find a set of undergrad work cubicles.  The grad students are through the doors to the left in the large room full of cubicles, in the center (the edges are mostly postdocs).  It helps to have someone tall enough to see over the cubicle walls.  There are also grad students on all the floors above this, both in the sections overlooking the main cubicle room and in the hallway lined with cubicles directly over the entrance.  Sometimes you can also find grad students in the labs on the other side of the building (2nd floor and above) as well.

  

Main Library (LIB)

Department: School of Library & Information Sciences

  

Buildings East of the Pentacrest

  

Biology Building (BB)

Department: Biology

Grad students are in the labs along the central hallway on the 2nd floor and above (the offices at the ends of the hallway are exclusively faculty).  Don’t be afraid to knock on lab doors, though sometimes you’ll find postdocs instead of grad students.

  

Biology Building East (BBE)

Department: Biology

Grad students are in the labs on the 2nd floor and above.  Don’t be afraid to knock on lab doors.  Some of the floors also have lounge areas near the staircases where you might also be able to find grad students.

  

Phillips Hall (PH)

Departments: Asian & Slavic Languages, French & Italian, Linguistics, Spanish & Portuguese

A large shared office on the 3rd floor houses most of the Spanish & Portuguese and Linguistics students.  It has three connected rooms, and practically anyone anywhere in those rooms is a grad student.  French & Italian is on the 5th floor, with grad students exclusively in the central rooms.  Asian & Slavic Languages grads are on the 6th floor, same setup.

  

Psychological & Brain Sciences Building (PBSB)

Department: Psychological & Brain Sciences

Large grad student lounge area on the 3rd floor; grad students in shared offices on the 2nd-4th floors.

  

Van Allen Hall (VAN)

Department: Physics & Astronomy

The grad student offices are scattered throughout the west end of the building (the east end is entirely classrooms), on the 3rd to 6th floors.  As usual, grad students are in the rooms with multiple names; be aware that postdocs occasionally share offices with grad students.  There is also a large cubicle room on the 4th floor where most of the 1st and 2nd year grads are located.

  

Buildings South of the Pentacrest

  

Jefferson Building (JB)

Departments: Classics, American Studies, Gender Women’s and Sexuality Studies, African American Studies

Classics grad students are in the offices in the center of the 2nd floor and one office on the 4th floor (straight to the right when you leave the stairwell).  GWSS is on the 4th floor as well, but rarely has any grad students, and African American Studies has no grad students.  American Studies is mostly on the 7th floor, with the main grad office to your left when you leave the stairs.  A couple other American Studies grad offices are scattered around the 5th-7th floors (check for the rooms with more than one name on the door).

  

Lindquist Center (LC)

Departments: College of Education (Educational Policy & Leadership Studies, Teaching & Learning, Rehabilitation & Counselor Education, Psychological & Quantitative Foundations)

This building is a maze, and I recommend visiting it with someone who knows the building.  It’s divided into two halves (you can tell which half you’re in because rooms are labeled N or S), with a bridge connecting them on the 3rd floor.  EPLS is much of the 4th floor in the North half (there is no 4th floor south); Counseling is on the 3rd floor north, with a few offices on the bridge between buildings; T&L is mostly on the 2nd floor north, but many of their grad students don’t have offices because they’re off-campus much of the time; P&Q is spread out around the south building, including a cubicle room on the first floor and a few scattered offices on higher floors.  Grad student offices either have multiple names on the door or just read “grad student office.”  There are also a couple computer labs that house grad students without regular offices.

  

Seamans Center (SC)

Departments: Computer Science, nearly all of the School of Engineering

The CS grads are all on the bottom floor (entrance across from the Main Library) and are reasonably accessible (if they’re there).  The engineering departments on the upper floors are a nightmare; the grads nearly all work in locked computer labs, and they often won’t let you in because some of them do classified research.  Each corner of the main building houses a different engineering department.  There are a few grad offices on the skybridge between the old and new sections of the building.

  

Voxman Music Building (VOX)

Department: Music

Grad student offices are the rooms with multiple names on them on the 4th and 5th floors.  They’re generally along the long hallways going to the corners of the building, closer to the center of the building.  Additional note: this building is often difficult to canvass, since many of the grads will be teaching lessons when they’re in, and nearly all of them are on 25% appointments and strapped for cash.
