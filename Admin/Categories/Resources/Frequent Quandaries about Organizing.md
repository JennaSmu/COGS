 **Specific FAQs (Frequently Asserted Quandaries)

  
  

- Q: “Let me think about it.”
    

- A: Most people mean “No” when they say this. So can I ask what’s giving you hesitation? I’m happy to answer any questions you might have. Trust me, I’ve heard it all. You can be honest.   
      
    
-   
    

- Q: “You can’t even bargain anymore. Why should I join if you can’t do anything?”
    

- A: This isn’t true. We fought to keep our benefits in policy after the law changed and we won. In January/February, we will sit down with the Board of Regents and bargain over wages and other important workplace issues, something even faculty have no control over since they don’t have a contract. We can also take collective action to move our priorities forward. Will you join us today?

- Q: “I disapprove of these office visits. They’re uncomfortable, and I’m just trying to work. It’s very aggressive.”
    

- A: I’m sorry to interrupt you, but this is how we reach our members - in the workplace. This is the tried and true method of union organizing that has worked here and across the country for decades. If you have ideas about organizing that you’d like to see happen, our efforts are coordinated by grad student volunteers just like you and me. You could bring your ideas to the table and implement them if you joined our union. Will you take a stand by joining our union today? 
    

  
  

- Q: “I don’t know, I think I’ll just wait to join. I’m still getting a grip on my finances.”
    

- A: I appreciate financial concerns but I have to be honest with you. We need members right now. Our union cannot be effective without members donating their time and their money to make it work. Will you take a stand by joining our union today? 
    

  
  

- Q: “I’m not really a ‘joiner.’”
    

- A: It takes all of us to do this work. As individuals we have no power in the workplace to stand up for ourselves or defend our rights. Our only power is when we come together as a team. Will you take a stand by joining our union today? 
    

  
  

- Q: “I can’t afford union dues.”
    

- A: As a grad student myself, I know firsthand it can be hard to balance any new expenses. But if our Union goes away, your out-of-pocket costs for your education could skyrocket. $29 will look like a bargain then. Will you take a stand by joining our union today? 
    

  
  

- Q: “What does it get me to become a dues-paying member? Don’t I already get the benefits anyway?”
    

- A: Yes, you are represented by our union whether or not you join, but our union only works when we have a large membership. Hundreds of other grad students pay their dues so that you can be represented and enjoy the benefits. If we all chip in a little, we all get a lot. Members can also vote on our budget, bargaining, and organizing plans, help elect officers, or run for leadership positions themselves. Will you take a stand by joining our union today? 
    

  
  

- Q: “Well, if the union can’t negotiate for anything except for wages, what can it even do anymore?”
    

- A: We have a big fight over wages coming up this year and we’re intent on winning guaranteed raises for you and every other grad student for the next two years. We are also fighting to bargain over other workplace issues, and a strong organized union can take collective action to move our campaigns forward outside of formal bargaining. The bottom line is there is power in numbers. The only reason we still have benefits in this year’s contract is because COGS members demanded it. The more members we have in our union, the more seriously the University will take us when we demand that your benefits and working conditions are equitable. Will you take a stand by joining our union today? 
    

  
  

- Q: “Where does the dues money go?”
    

- A: Dues money goes toward building a stronger Union for our members. It goes toward things like office space, organizing efforts, and grievance arbitration. We’re a lean organization, and our budget is set and approved by our members. 
    

  
  

- Q: “I don’t like unions,” or, “I don’t like the people who run the union.”
    

- We are the union. All of our members and officers are graduate employees just like you. Everything we do is decided on by our members.
    
- All of us run our union. So if you want to see a change in who runs it, you should join. You deserve a voice and a vote as much as the next person.
    
- Pushback on “I don’t like unions” individualism. Remind them higher education is under attack, there are new rounds of budget cuts every year, and grad students don’t stand a chance against those top-down trends unless we are organized and stick together. The only reason we have the wages and benefits, tuition waivers, and fee waivers we enjoy now is because of our union. Will you take a stand by joining our union today? 
    

  
  

- Q: “Nah, I’m alright. I can take care of myself.”
    

- A: Just making it to grad school means you're a capable person, and the same is true for me. But having each other to depend upon increases our power should we ever face a problem that needs addressing. Standing together means standing stronger. Will you take a stand by joining our union today?**
