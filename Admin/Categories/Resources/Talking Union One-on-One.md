> [!tip]- Listen  
> Don't just talk, listen. You know what issues are important to you, but other problems may be more important to your co-workers. Let them tell you what they think the problems are and then talk with them about how getting involved in the union could help solve these problems. 

> [!tip]- Be Honest, Be Yourself  
> If you don't know the answer to a question, admit it, but tell your coworker that you will get the answer, Then be sure to follow through as soon as possible and get the information back to the person with the question. 

> [!tip]- Keep Your Temper  
> Some of your bosses and co-workers may try to get you to lose your temper if they you are a union supporter. Don't fall for that trick. If you get angry, hold it inside until you can talk with another union leader. 

> [!tip]- Focus on your coworkers  
> Concentrate on talking to your co-workers, not your bosses. Your boss may try to engage you in talk about the union. It's either to pick your brain or to keep you from talking to other workers. Remember, we build union power with active members, not backroom deal with the boss. 

> [!tip]- Show Respect  
> Right now, some people are scared and some people are ignorant about unions - which isn't the same thing as being stupid. If you think that you know more than someone else, share the information. Don't let the boss isolate anyone. If you're stronger than someone else, or less scared, share your strength and pick the right time and place to strike up a conversation. 

> [!tip]- Stuck? Try Another Way  
> We have to convince people, not push them around. If you have a person you can't convince, find out what's holding them back, and try to answer their doubts. Maybe you're not the right person to talk union with them. Think about who has influence over this person and go get them to help you out. 

> [!tip]- Take a Break  
> You may catch yourself talking nothing but union. That can be hard on you but also hard on your coworkers. Find out what else is going on in their lives. 

> [!tip]- Be a Good Example  
> People will judge the union by how they feel about the leaders and stewards. If they think you are a good worker and a good person, they'll respect the union. If they see you come in late everyday or pick fights, they won't take the union seriously. 

> [!tip]- Stay United  
> Make sure someone is talking to every worker. Every employer wants us to fight with each other. They'll try to play full-timers against part-timers and they'll tell workers in different departments that they have nothing in common. They may try to get higher paid workers fighting lower-paid workers, black workers against white, and men against women. We're all in this together, and we've got to stay together.
