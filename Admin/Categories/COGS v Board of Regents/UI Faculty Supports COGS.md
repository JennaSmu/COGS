[This letter was previously published in the¬†_Press-Citizen_ on February 10, 2017](http://www.press-citizen.com/story/opinion/letters-to-the-editor/2017/02/10/ui-faculty-supports-students-cogs/97393300/)

To The Editor:

We, the undersigned faculty members of the University of Iowa, offer our full support for the graduate student employees of the University of Iowa and their representatives in COGS (the Campaign to Organize Graduate Students). Graduate students are an essential part of the university community and play a crucial role in fulfilling the university‚Äôs academic mission.

In recent negotiations, the administration has refused to commit to providing graduate student employees with quality health care benefits in their next contract with COGS. In a comment to the _Daily Iowan_, Graduate College Dean John Keller cited uncertainty regarding potential legislative changes to Chapter 20 of the Iowa code, the section of state law that governs collective-bargaining rights. The uncertainty, Keller claimed, ‚Äúputs a substantial damper on our ability to provide some assurances. We don‚Äôt know exactly what we‚Äôre going to be able to negotiate on and at what level until the state has determined what they‚Äôre going to do.‚Äù But the expected changes to Chapter 20 would affect only what unions like COGS can negotiate, not what employers can offer. Any uncertainty about future legislative changes has nothing to do with the ethical obligation to treat graduate students fairly. Beyond ethics, denying graduate students crucial benefits would hamstring the university‚Äôs efforts to recruit and retain the most talented scholars‚Äîefforts crucial to the UI‚Äôs mission as an R1 research university.

We‚Äôll state our belief clearly: a university that benefits substantially from the labor and scholarly contributions of its graduate students should provide them with quality, affordable health insurance.
