Don't let the 'nice' letters fool you: if they wanted to protect our benefits, they would have agreed to put them in our contract before the law changed. Instead, they refused to bargain with us until the law changed and then gleefully proposed cuts. Watch what they do, not what they say. And what they did was propose the monstrosity below. Among the benefitsÂ benefits that are cut (they were conveniently omitted from the University's letter) are:

- all our leave (paid leave, sick leave, bereavement leave, holidays)
- hours of work (they could double your hours and keep your pay the same)
- our grievance procedure (no neutral third party would adjudicate disputes)
- their commitment to provide us with a safe workplace
- their commitment to promote human rights and end discrimination

You don't need to take our word for it. See for yourself:
