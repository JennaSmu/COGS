First of all, congrats on graduating!

Unfortunately, COGS has no way to know if you have graduated until sometime in July when we get a list of current bargaining unit members that are employed from the University. We need you to **contact us or log into your membership accounts to cancel** or pause your membership. If you have graduated and would like to discontinue membership, please access your account and cancel your membership in your account. If you are currently paying dues through ACH debits (not debit or credit card), please email us, or fill out the contact form on the website.

For reference: Dues are post-paid just like your appointment stipends. For example, your last pay check for the academic year is June 1st and your last dues payment on June 2nd would be for that same pay period (May). If you are graduating in May, your last dues payment would be June 2nd.

If you have any questions about your membership or issues with dues payments, let us know!
