Our new contract guarantees a 100% tuition scholarship at the College of Liberal Arts and Sciences tuition rate, but some people have not had the scholarship appropriately credited to their accounts. Check your U-bill, and call the University billing office if you think you might have a problem.

Also, please let COGS know if you have been charged a "Late Fee" for not paying a U-bill with an incorrectly calculated tuition assessment.
