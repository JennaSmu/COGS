| Yellow Area Steward       | John Jepsen      | I am a history student who focuses on energy, environment, and labor. I have volunteered with COGS during both Blitzes this past year, and the experience taught me that creating relationships is the key to a sustainable union. As an area steward I would seek to create relationships across the disciplines in order to organize all graduate students under the COGS banner. This is a watershed moment for this organization and I want to be of service to my fellow graduate employees in the pursuit of fair wages, fair treatment, and a just workplace.                         |

| Political Action Chair    | Danielle Hoskins | I have an interest in COGS and politics.¬† I am a PhD candidate in the History Department, working on a dissertation about American women in politics in the postwar era. I have been a COGS member for several years now, but I have been looking for a chance to take a more active role in COGS. I do have some experience regarding politics, as I volunteered during the 2016 campaign season.¬† In the past I have been a delegate to the US Senate Youth Program, and on campus I have been a Graduate Student Senate representative, and co-President of the Graduate History Society. |
