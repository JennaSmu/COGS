Are you looking for an opportunity to help your fellow graduate students?  COGS is announcing openings on three committees.  Please consider getting involved!

Social Committee

The Social Committee will provide recommendations about the needs and wants (and wishes) of COGS members with respect to the Social Events throughout the year. Specifically, we want to ensure that our events (a) attract large numbers of members and their families, (b) consider the interests of everyone in our community and design events that can meet them (c) are connected with our other organizing efforts (e.g. post-Blitz success party somewhat like last year’s victory party), (d) are inclusive in the widest sense possible, (e) continue to strengthen our solidarity and build our community, and (f) are so much damn fun that people remember them with fondness for years to come!

If you would like to help with any or all of the above (or if you just want to make sure your interests are heard and well represented), please consider joining the Social Committee. You can contact me (Phillip Ricks, Social Event Coordinator) at [philthyfx@gmail.com](chrome-extension://bpmcpldpdmajfigpchkicefoigmkfalc/views/qowt.html#mailto:philthyfx@gmail.com). As we move closer to the events, we may need Committee members to perform certain tasks (e.g. phoning venues or rental agencies, helping with blast email drafts, or even simple things like bringing ice or a serving spoon or a tablecloth—you get the picture). Here’s looking forward to a wonderful year of solidarity, communion, and working together for the betterment of our future and the future of all graduate students!

Social Media Committee

Are you always online?   We need folks to help us update the website and get the news out to members through all exciting forms of social media.
