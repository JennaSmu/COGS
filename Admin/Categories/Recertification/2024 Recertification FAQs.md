## 2024 RECERTIFICATION FAQs

COGS is an independent, democratically run graduate student worker union. We are **not** affiliated with the university. COGS not only **bargains over graduate employee contracts**, but also supports graduate students year round in concrete ways such as **winning back money for overwork.**Since COGS organized as a union over 25 years ago, we **won full tuition scholarships** for graduate workers, **improved our health care options,** and **reduced mandatory fees** through bargaining with the Board of Regents.

Since 2017, the state of Iowa has attempted to destroy all public sector unions including COGS, by forcing us to hold a recertification election. Our election is held every two years before going into contract re-negotiations with the university. Recertifying means that COGS will continue to legally represent graduate workers on campus.
