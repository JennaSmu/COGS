  - Demand NO CUTS in a Visit to UI President
Type: "[[Political Actions]]"
---
As a group, we will visit Harreld's office and ask him to publicly state that the University of Iowa does not support cuts to graduate workers' wages or benefits. JOIN US! We want as many graduate workers to be present as possible to show the university that we want them to stand by us and to defend us. We want our officials to end the uncertainty many of us have about our own welfare and the welfare of those that depend on our work.

We belong to, and are valued members of, the UI family and community: to refuse to defend graduate workers' benefits and wages is to treat us like we are disposable.
