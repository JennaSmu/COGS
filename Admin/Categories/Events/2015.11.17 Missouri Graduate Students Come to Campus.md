COGS is hosting guest speakers from University of Missouri on Tuesday, November 17th. Samuel Cohen, Associate Professor in English and Jim Hayden, a graduate student in English representing the Coalition of Graduate Workers will be speaking at several events. Hear them speak at 7 pm at the Campus Community Assembly organized by Iowans Defending our Public Universities held in Van Allen, Lecture Room 1. Then come over to Joe’s at 8:30 pm to hear Sam and Jim speak at the November COGS Social.  
CGW is currently organizing a union with NEA to represent 2,800 grad students at the University of Missouri. COGS has maintained a close relationship with CGW. Eric Scott, co-chairman of the Coalition of Graduate Workers said, “Our biggest inspiration is the University of Iowa. They have been extremely successful in their ways of running and structuring their union. (COGS) is involved and invested in keeping itself running. Everyone is active and engaged in the campus rather than just paying dues and voting,” Scott said. This is the MU coalition’s hope for its future union.
