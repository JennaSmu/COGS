Hello all,

We will be holding our second membership meeting of the semester this Thursday, September 24th at 5:30 pm at the COGS office. Â Many of you have expressed concerns about the Board of Regents appointment of Bruce Harreld as President of UI. Â We will be discussing way to address these concerns as they impact graduate students - potential further cuts to teaching and research, continued defunding of graduate programs, etc.

We will also be discussing our FEES campaign and event with Attorney Joseph Cohen on October 8th and our upcoming Halloween Party!

In addition, we will be planning forÂ our Spring 20th Anniversary Event!

Don't miss out on this important meeting, your voice matters inside COGS! Â I look forward to seeing you on Thursday.

In solidarity,  
Jeannette Gabriel, President
