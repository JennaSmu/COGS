Greetings! You are cordially invited to the 22nd annual Coalition of Graduate Employee Unions (CGEU) conference and the 9th annual Canadian Coalition of Graduate Employee Unions conference, hosted concurrently by United Electrical, Radio, and Machine Workers of America Local 896/Campaign to Organize Graduate Students (COGS). This year’s conference will be held on the campus of the University of Iowa from August 2-3, 2013.

The C/CGEU was formed to support the organization of new graduate student employee unions; to strengthen established unions; and to provide a forum for graduate employee unionists to meet, share information, and work together toward common goals. The annual conference features workshops on organizing, leadership development, negotiation strategies, and member mobilization.

The Organizing Committee is excited  to announce two keynote speakers. Martin Ritter, an organizer with the [Chicago Teachers Union](http://www.ctunet.com/), will cover developments with CTU's struggle in support of educators and against school closures in Chicago in recent months. Peter Fisher, of the [Iowa Policy Project](http://www.iowapolicyproject.org/), will also address the conference, covering issues of union density in relation to income and quality of life and the role that anti-union organizations like ALEC have had in rolling back the gains of unions.

We invite you to participate on panels and/or in workshops on a variety of subjects. Possible topics might include:

- Organizing in a Right-to-Work (for less) State: Examples and Strategies
- Fighting “Back Door Tuition”: Bargaining Against Increased Student Fees
- Effective Use of Social Media
- Higher Education and the Labor Movement: Where Do We Fit In?
- Developing New Leaders
- Building Coalitions On and Off Campus
- Political Action and Legislative Fightback: On ALEC and other Woes
- Strengthening Steward System/Training

You’ll find other options on the registration form, including panels on bargaining contexts. If you would like to propose a panel or workshop not listed above, there will be a space on the electronic registration form to do so. We look forward to your suggestions.
