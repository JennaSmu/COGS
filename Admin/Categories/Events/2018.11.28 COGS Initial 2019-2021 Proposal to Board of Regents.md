  - COGS Initial 2019-2021 Proposal to Board of Regents
---
Please attend our initial contract proposal session to the Board of Regents. We will share our proposal for the 2019-2021 contract. Your physical presence matters as it shows that we have aÂ collective voice, that COGS represents many, not just the few who are speaking. You are not expected to say anything and you do not have to stay the whole time but please consider showing your support by being in the room! The second date is the Board of Regents proposal to COGS- please attend that one as well.

11/28 noon @IMU 351: our initial proposal
