The first day of our annual Fall membership drive was a success! Volunteers and organizers went out to the Computer Science, Math, and Physics department to talk to potential new members. They had great and productive conversations that resulted in a total of EIGHT new members!

One of our overall organizing goals this year is to build strength and membership in departments that have historically had lower COGS membership.
