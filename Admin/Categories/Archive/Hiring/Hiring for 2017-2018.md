The Campaign to Organize Graduate Students seeks qualified applicants for its 2017-18 staff positions. The upcoming academic year will be a challenging one for COGS, but one filled with opportunities to connect with fellow workers and grow as a union. We are hiring for two important positions: the organizer dedicates time to talking with graduate employees, recruiting new members, and engaging students across campus; the [COGS Officer Coordinator Position](./COGS%20Officer%20Coordinator%20Position.md) maintains the member database, organizes mailings, and performs other administrative tasks.

Both of these positions are crucial to COGS's work representing and fighting for graduate workers at the University of Iowa. Each position is part-time (10 hours/week averaged over the employment period, or approximately a 25% appointment) and applicants should apply to [cogs@cogs.org](mailto:cogs@cogs.org) by June 1, 2017.Â Please read the calls for each position carefully and [contact us](http://cogs.org/contact-us) with any questions.
