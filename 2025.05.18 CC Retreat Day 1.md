# Broadstripes:

- Broadstripes need to be manually updated. 
	- I can do that in Obsidian. 
	- My pie in the sky idea: Replace Broadstripes with Obsidian. 
	- Dataview or scripts that check the list for doubles for us. 
- COGS needs to fight to get the list. 
	- First week of September and January if we are lucky. So, twice a year.

# Hear from UE National:

- Valentina is the director of communications
- Grad conference board - UE has a history of boards, ways to collaborate on lots of different issues. 
	- Getting this started for the different UE locals. 
	- Each UE local will decide whether to affiliate, then decide 3 reps. 

## What COGS wants to see from UE:
- Solidarity actions between multiple universities. 
- More opportunities to have more UE presence. 
- State networks.
- Legal support. 
- Push as a resolution: Pay UE lawyers more. 
	- Right now, they are limited in how much they can get paid so it is hard to get good lawyers. 
- Clearer information on what we can and cannot protect you from.
