The University of Iowa has been creating economic insecurity by charging graduate students exorbitant FEES to cover basic University administrative costs. Graduate employees taking a full course load lose $932.00 in pay to these fees each year, making the wage scale and tuition scholarship much less meaningful. This is an entire monthâ€™s pay for graduate employees with 25% appointments. The fees the University of Iowa charges force graduate students into a cycle of poverty and debt. Our future is being leveraged to offload basic University expenses.

Now is the time to say PAY IT BACK! Join COGS Week of Action, August 25th to 29th.
