**The UI makes you pay "health" fees¬†_on top_¬†of your health insurance plan.**¬†Every year, we pay $14 for ‚Äúmental health‚Äù and $139 for ‚Äústudent health‚Äù ‚Äî that‚Äôs entirely¬†_separate_¬†from what you already pay for your UI GradCare health insurance premiums.¬†

The University claims they need to charge you these fees so they can pay for vague ‚Äúwellness initiatives.‚Äù But the University of Iowa does not need our $153 a year.¬†[The UI has already committed to spending more than $1.4 billion on construction projects over the next five years, including spending millions on hospital projects and healthcare research facilities.](http://link.broadstripes.com/ls/click?upn=PmcirmZW4VDUbNhaP3fYdO4GYFvPTYwKI0JNY6xdNScfaWCAKoJfzA9kL-2B6Rq0t51Xn4ZFuX71BIrCkY1QP36i8QtYr51oOR9KryRwXpMwwgubXssSlyVTU3ymgDt-2ByxcTNPcDAg4jUjtzROSCLGOE1wKVzDgibXXyJGEMtWAXFqowqWMqS85RkxGQnkM3QwG76GBWDakhW21wJGNHqCWe-2BLECumooHBz0VWCxhisYDtjWExqmdG3bGMymgWIQcO-2BeAmBTeYAl-2BvOU8gpaG-2FY-2FV4wMcaAsFyQoQH8Ak8CJ4h1ULMUXCh1vVMc4JPGm-2BhRYTnYCmiyy2cjHiq8jZ9UA-3D-3DOoqT_e8bG-2BoKGxR5QLzm0sCmSzP0JYhUtYWidIqS7vhS7WmkwscoQ6XQ9-2Bt9ExHwYyfrM5tFJTiwpp7mXp2cULcPyPTcGMlzuwE76rCiUkZV-2BRZAn2Y41e1wXTfUntlfr3ZCphSL-2FtL367o1uTfQ1-2FESx3ymyzXx4PhMKvn4jbfc8m9e472jplAubhb13vip7i-2F5RZGE5KJLWsF9WXItMtJlvyTfRppvjgAHpsyVKv4pJwpsO6UgCH5bB2BvTvQgpl3W24BE1ivxK3q8TnlTkIv7k-2FwajpHIl8l-2FQWrbVisFkD5mWgnLYFTza-2F-2FCf2xzeLM0VRpyuBVzaSslWvbrphhalUR7y6m4Uc-2BKKIKi59oqK1l74e4eSn453tq9qArpx-2FK0wzm4aDqhI2M-2FQ01tikmW4BQDYR34hGWnlqPqHEaFc9RGjjr0V-2FuhmD3rzRxQi63vTxquMvKwXoiexJ0slp9McaQ-3D-3D)¬†Years ago, COGS successfully negotiated that the University pay for 90% of our healthcare premium costs. We already have healthcare. These ‚Äúhealth‚Äù fees that the UI forces us to pay are simply a tax on teaching and research assistants.

|---|---|
|**Building Fee**|$67.50|
|**Recreation Facility Fee**|$164|

|   |   |
|---|---|
|**IMU Facilities Fee**|$100|

The University alleges these fees you pay go to the maintenance and upkeep of buildings. **Do cashiers have to pay for their cash registers? Do administrators have to pay for the offices they work in?**

|   |   |
|---|---|
|**International Student Fee**|$250|
|**International Graduate Matriculation Fee (first semester)**|$325|

International students have to pay even more. First semester international students have to somehow pay over $1000 before they have even received their first paycheck. The University alleges the yearly fee funds International Students and Scholars Services (ISSS) and the matriculation fee funds orientation programming and ‚Äúenrolling them in their classes.‚Äù Again, these are not the responsibility of graduate students to pay.
