# Increasing Membership:
- Sliding dues
- Time commitment can be too much for too many people.
- [ ] #outreach Provide different meeting times or child care for graduate students that are parents.
- Need to have people have a positive experience with the union. 
- Lead people to the answer. If you ask, "On a scale of 1-10, how likely are you to become a COGS member right now?" and they give a 2, you can say "So, why not a 0?"

# COGS 30th Anniversary:
- [ ] #outreach Reach out to founding COGS members.
	- Ask Greg Cross
- #ðŸ“…-event/brainstorming Have a 30th Anniversary working group (4-5 members, max)
	- Ask at GMM. 

# Orientations:
- COGS is not allowed to present at any orientations. 
- Reserve the room for orientations right after they finish. 
	- So, we slid in. 
- Can be outside, can hand out flyers. 

# Making [GMMs](./General%20Membership%20Meetings.md) better:
- It feels like COGS runs itself. 
- More action items AT the meeting. 
- Chairs in a circle, Socratic style. 
- Need greeters and name tags. 
- Casual for an organization meeting can read off as disorganized. 
- [GMM](./General%20Membership%20Meetings.md) checklist so we know what to bring every time. 
- First-timers guide to a COGS meeting. 
	- A tri-fold thing. 
- "Learn" as a theme might not pull people in. 
	- People may feel that they can learn from Google. 
- Need to give the vibe that COGS needs help. 
- Less break-out groups, more menu selection or big asks. 
- Time for general membership to speak to the [CC](./Coordinating%20Committee.md). 
- Minutes are an informational document that recorded what happened. 


# Summer Office Employee:
- [ ] #outreach Hire someone for a Summer Office Employee by June 1st. They will help to digitalize data and clean up the office. [Anne Moore](./Anne%20Moore.md), [Miranda Schene](./Miranda%20Schene.md), and [Jay Smuszkiewicz](./Jay%20Smuszkiewicz.md) will read resumes.
	- Might be [Jessica Douglass-Eurich](./Jessica%20Douglass-Eurich.md).
